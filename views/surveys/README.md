# Surveys

* Surveys are hosted on Google Drive using a Google Form which then sends the submitted form data to a linked Google Spreadsheet. 
* The following files are responsible for automatically downloading a csv with the survey data which is then processed by a python script that creates new insert statements for each new value in the csv.
